**Learning from the code **

1. Make Constructor private while creating Singleton class so that user can not initialized object every time. It should allow following singleton theory.

2. Always prefer abstract classes vs enum to allow Open for extension closed for modification principle.

3. In this code we have created  ParkingSpotEnum for handling all the classes which is extending Parking Spot Class.
